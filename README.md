# OpenPantry
Opensource Pantry Organization System with inventory tracking

The main intent of this project is to create a software/tools that will help organize and track home pantry. Too many time I have had to stuggle to remember if something is in the Pantry and where exactly is it.

Using this software one should be able to maintain the shelf/cabinet location and be able to track the product details with the UPC code. 

End goal is to be able to use an App to scan and record locations of the inventory, sync to a database application locally or in the app. Future goal is to keep the inventory data clean with periodic checks and audits prompted by the App
